This is the JSON parsing libarary, version 19.8.2013, SVN trunk revision 58

To get the original go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/cjson/.

Local changes to cJSON in Wolframe:

 * renamed test.c to testit.c (avoid collision with 'test' phony target),
   heavily fixed to pass a C compiler, reactivated file-based tests

 * added a cJSON_Context and removed global variable for error position
   to make the library thread-safe

 * removed GetErrorPtr and use the variable errorptr in cJSON_Context as
   last error info

 * return Number type elements also as string transformation is done by
   normalization in forms

 * cJSON_AddItemToObject, cJSON_AddItemReferenceToArray and 
   cJSON_AddItemReferenceToObject:
   doing some error handling and returning an int to indicate the error

 * print_number: added error handling after malloc, return 0 if malloc fails
